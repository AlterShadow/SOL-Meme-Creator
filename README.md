# GETTING STARTED:

To get started with creating and minting SPL tokens, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine using below command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WhiskerWise/solana-memecoin-token-creator.git
   ```
   Or alternatively download the .zip & extract to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory using below command:

   ```bash
   cd solana-memecoin-token-creator
   ```
3. Make sure you have node.js installed on your system, if not you can download it from the below link:

   https://nodejs.org/en/download

   **You can also follow the below link for the installation process:**

   https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/installation-of-node-js-on-windows/

4. Install the project dependencies using below command:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
5. Edit the .env.copy file & add the required fields. If you have a custom RPC, you can replace it with yours.

    ``PRIVATE_KEY=YourPrivateKeyHere``

    ``RPC_ENDPOINT=Keep it default or add your RPC``
6. Rename .env.copy file to .env
   
   **You can do a manual rename or use below command:**

   ```bash
   mv .env.copy .env
   ```
8. Create your token:

   Run the following command to start the token creation process:

   ```bash

11. Token Creation:

   - The script will create and send the mint token transaction, etc.
   - You will receive updates on the transaction's success, transaction hash, and links to view the transaction on Solana Explorer and Solana BirdEye (if on the mainnet).

11. **Congratulations! You've successfully created your own Memecoin token on the Solana blockchain.**

## IMPORTANT INFORMATION:

- **Use the Rugpull feature to pull the liquidity in the time given during the prompts. Ideal value would be 120-300s (2-5mins). If you don't wish to rugpull, then set the value as 0.**

- **Make sure you are on the mainnet while creating the token & have enough SOL (Min 2 SOL) to cover the fee for token creation, LP addition, Mint, etc. Else, you may lose the transaction fee for the already completed transactions & might get error as your wallet doesn't have enough balance to proceed further. Setting value to 0 for Mint, Renounced, Burn will not include any charges.** 

- **Cost of adding the Liquidity is upon the user, you can choose to add 5 SOL or 50 SOL, it's upto you. Recommended min LP size is 5 SOL for 50-80% supply. Make sure to have equivalent SOL in your wallet, else the transaction will fail.**

- **You can set royalty to get tax % on transactions.**

- **This project is designed for local use, and your wallet's secret key is not stored or transmitted over the internet. It's important to keep your wallet's secret key secure and never share it with anyone. The token creation process is entirely local, and your wallet's secret key is only used for transaction signing within the script.**

- **Why give it for free?**
  
  **This project will be free only for short period of time as a marketing strategy to get some eyes on it. I'll be making the repo private & will be charging SOL for the access later on. If you are here & seeing this repo, then congrats, you get this tool for free. Spread the word & let your friends know when you make profits from this.**
